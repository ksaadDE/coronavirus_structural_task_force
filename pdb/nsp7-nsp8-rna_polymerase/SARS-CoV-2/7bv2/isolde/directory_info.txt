These are manual re-refinements from ISOLDE in ChimeraX, done by Tristan Croll. Structures were energy-minimised, visually checked residue-by-residue and, where necessary, rebuilt. Crystal structures were further refined with phenix.refine. ISOLDE is based on interactive molecular dynamics flexible fitting (AMBER force field, biased by the electron density map). Everythingâ€™s based on energies (parameterisations based on QM calculations on model compounds) rather than statistical penalty terms. Some of the changes are in development and only available through via the interactive python shell.

Files (not all of these will be present in any given directory):

notes.txt - work notes on this refinement from Tristan Croll.
working.cxs - A ChimeraX session file (requires ChimeraX 0.92 with ISOLDE installed) containing the model with any extra restraints used during rebuilding. See the relevant notes.txt for further detail.
*.xml - an OpenMM forcefield definition file for a ligand required for working with the model in ISOLDE. Load it in ISOLDE using the "Load custom residue definition(s) button"
working_3_noh.cif - the model (without hydrogens) as saved from ISOLDE, without further refinement. Currently only provided for cryo-EM models. Other forms (e.g. with hydrogens, or a ChimeraX session file) can be provided on request.
<pdbid>_refine_<number>.cif - model rebuilt in ISOLDE and refined with phenix.refine. Coordinates are identical to <pdbid>_refine_<number>.pdb.
<pdbid>_refine_<number>.pdb - model rebuilt in ISOLDE and refined with phenix.refine. Coordinates are identical to <pdbid>_refine_<number>.cif.
<pdbid>_refine_<number>.mtz - Map amplitudes and phases calculated by phenix.refine
