# PDB 7cwm

## Overview

**Protein name**: surface glycoprotein

**Organism**: SARS-CoV-2

**Method**: Cryo-EM

## Description

EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein one RBD in open state and two RBDs in closed state in complex with Fab P17. Hetero nonamer, spike with three chains and Fab with a heavy and a light chain with three chains each. P17 together with H014 revealed that neutralization was achieved by S1 shielding and conformational locking.
