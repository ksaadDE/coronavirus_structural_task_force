SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 61 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 9 residues (14.8%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 1 residues (1.64%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 20 residues (32.79%) are helix-like, 5 residues (8.20%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
