# PDB 7kdg

## Overview

**Protein name**: surface glycoprotein

**Organism**: SARS-CoV-2

**Method**: Cryo-EM

## Description

Em structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein trimer, RBD down with the D614G mutation and without the P986-987 mutation. A homo trimer with three chains. The D614G mutation alters the spike conformation in SARS-CoV-2 and the protease cleavage susceptibility at the S1/S2 junction. The P986-987 mutation has a stabilizing effect but the paper shows that even without the mutation the protein is stable.
