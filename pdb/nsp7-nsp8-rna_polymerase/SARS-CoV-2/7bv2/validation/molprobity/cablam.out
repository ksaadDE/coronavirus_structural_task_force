SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 987 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 37 residues (3.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 10 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.41%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 425 residues (43.06%) are helix-like, 118 residues (11.96%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
