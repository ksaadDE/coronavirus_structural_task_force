- Some missing sidechains in structurally important locations (e.g. Phe A101, Ile A114)
- Filled in single-residue chain break at A74-A76
- Filled in single-residue chain break at B144-146
- Zinc binding site in chain A Cys301-Cys306-Cys31-His295 mis-modelled as Cys301-306 disulfide
- Built missing C-terminal domain of chain D based on equivalent domain from chain B (positioning is equivalent to that seen for SARS in 6nur)
