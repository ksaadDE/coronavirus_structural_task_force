# PDB 2gdt

## Overview

**Protein name**: leader protein

**Organism**: SARS-CoV

**Method**: NMR

## Description

First structure of SARS-CoV NSP1 (leader protein). This NMR structure showed a previously unknown beta barrel fold. The protein has been shown to inihibit the host cell ribosome and change the cell chemistry in various ways. It mediates RNA cleavage. Consensus structure (ensemble deposited as 2HSX).

## Comments On The Structure

many Ramachandran outliers

`Vincent Chen`

Similar crystal structures in the PDB which have a similar fold to 2gdt (3zbd and 5xbc, for example) from different viruses.  It doesn't directly say whether 2gdt is correct, but lends credence to the idea that it might actually be a novel fold.  It might be worth taking a closer look at 3zbd and 5xbc though, for a start.
