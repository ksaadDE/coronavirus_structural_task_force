SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1042 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 98 residues (9.4%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 31 residues (3.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 8 residues (0.77%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 439 residues (42.13%) are helix-like, 127 residues (12.19%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 4 residues (0.38%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.10%) are correctable to beta
