SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 952 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 45 residues (4.7%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 16 residues (1.7%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 9 residues (0.95%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 535 residues (56.20%) are helix-like, 80 residues (8.40%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.21%) are correctable to helix, 1 residues (0.11%) are correctable to beta
