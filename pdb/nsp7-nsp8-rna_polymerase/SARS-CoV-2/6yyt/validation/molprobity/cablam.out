SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1274 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 65 residues (5.1%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 13 residues (1.0%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 7 residues (0.55%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 609 residues (47.80%) are helix-like, 132 residues (10.36%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 2 residues (0.16%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
