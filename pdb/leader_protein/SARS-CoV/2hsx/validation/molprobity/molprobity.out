  Interpretation: bad |Rama-Z| > 3; suspicious 2 < |Rama-Z| < 3; good |Rama-Z| < 2.
  Scores for whole/helix/sheet/loop are scaled independently;
  therefore, the values are not related in a simple manner.
    whole: -5.34 (0.60), residues: 114
    helix: -2.78 (1.10), residues: 15
    sheet: -2.22 (0.85), residues: 28
