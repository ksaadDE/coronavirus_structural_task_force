  Rama-Z (Ramachandran plot Z-score):
  Interpretation: bad |Rama-Z| > 3; suspicious 2 < |Rama-Z| < 3; good |Rama-Z| < 2.
  Scores for whole/helix/sheet/loop are scaled independently;
  therefore, the values are not related in a simple manner.
    whole: -7.20 (0.39), residues: 156
    helix:  None (None), residues: 0
    sheet: -4.14 (1.11), residues: 12
    loop : -5.49 (0.30), residues: 144
