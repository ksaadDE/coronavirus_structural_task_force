This folder contains PDB_REDO results. PDB-REDO is a procedure to optimise 
crystallographic structure models, providing algorithms that make a fully 
automated decision making system for refinement, rebuilding and validation. Please note that PDB-REDO is an automatic procedure and cannot fix major modelling errors.

If you are not an expert user, and you would like to look at a 
standard PDB entry, you can also access the PDB-REDO results in Coot, via File 
> Fetch PDB & Map using PDB-REDO...
