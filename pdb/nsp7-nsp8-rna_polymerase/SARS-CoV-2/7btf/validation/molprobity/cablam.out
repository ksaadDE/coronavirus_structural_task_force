SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 1189 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 123 residues (10.3%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 40 residues (3.4%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 9 residues (0.76%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 471 residues (39.61%) are helix-like, 165 residues (13.88%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 1 residues (0.08%) are correctable to helix, 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to beta
