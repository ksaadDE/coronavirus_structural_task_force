SUMMARY: Note: Regardless of number of alternates, each residue is counted as having at most one outlier.
SUMMARY: CaBLAM found 186 full protein residues and 0 CA-only residues
SUMMARY: 9 residues (4.8%) have disfavored conformations. (<=5% expected).
SUMMARY: 3 residues (1.6%) have outlier conformations. (<=1% expected)
SUMMARY: 2 residues (1.08%) have severe CA geometry outliers. (<=0.5% expected)
SUMMARY: 96 residues (51.61%) are helix-like, 20 residues (10.75%) are beta-like
SUMMARY: 0 residues (0.00%) are correctable to helix, 2 residues (1.08%) are correctable to beta
